'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|k|s|l|i}} (26 July 1894nbsp;– 22 November 1963) was an English writer, philosopher and a prominent member of the [[Huxley family]].

He was best known for his novels including ''[[Brave New World]]'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, and for non-fiction books, such as ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', which recalls experiences when taking a [[psychedelic drug]], and a wide-ranging output of essays. Early in his career Huxley edited the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', and published short stories and poetry. Mid career and later, he published travel writing, film stories and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the US, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. In 1962, a year before his death, he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]].ref[http://rslit.org/companions-of-literature Companions of Literature]. Royal Society of Literature. Retrieved 5 January 2015/ref

Huxley was a [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], and [[Satire|satirist]].  Huxley later became interested in spiritual subjects such as [[parapsychology]] and philosophical [[mysticism]],ref{{cite book |last=Thody |first=Philipe |title=Huxley: A Biographical Introduction |year=1973 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0-289-70188-1}}/refref{{cite book |author=David K.

== Early life ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}
Aldous Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded [[Prior's Field School]].  Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]].  Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[Zoology|zoologist]], agnostic and controversialist (Darwin's Bulldog). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists.  Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].refHolmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p.nbsp;5/ref

Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, then went to [[Hillside School, Malvern]]. His teacher was his mother, who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at [[Eton College]]. Huxley's mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911, he suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which left [him] practically blind for two to three years.ref{{cite book| last = Huxley | first=Aldous |year=1939 |chapter=Biography and bibliography (appendix) |title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan | series = 1st Perennial Classic |page=243 |publisher=Harper  Row}}/ref Aldous volunteered to join the army at the outbreak of [[World War I]], but was rejected on health grounds: he was half-blind in one eye. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and later graduated (BA) with first class honours. His brother Julian wrote:
{{Quote | I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.refJulian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto  Windus, London. p.nbsp;22/ref}}

Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at [[Eton College|Eton]], where Eric Blair (later to become [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn't keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.ref name= Crick{{cite book |last= Crick |first= Bernard | title = George Orwell: A Life |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books | location =London |isbn=978-0-14-014563-2}}/ref For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the [[Air Ministry]].

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically advanced [[Tata Chemicals Europe|Brunner and Mond]] chemical plant in [[Billingham]], Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) states that this experience of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was one source for the novel.ref{{cite book | last =Baggini |first= Julian |title=Atheism |url= http://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnECpg=PA86 |year=2009 |publisher = Sterling  |isbn = 978-1-4027-6882-8 |page= 86}}/ref

== Career ==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s. His first published novels were social satires, beginning with ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921).

===Bloomsbury Set===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members – [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]].]]
During World War I, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]] near Oxford, home of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. Here he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]]ref{{Citation | last = Weber | first = Michel | author-link = Michel Weber | url = https://www.academia.edu/3268912/_On_Religiousness_and_Religion._Huxleys_Reading_of_Whiteheads_Religion_in_the_Making_in_the_Light_of_James_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience_2005_ | title = On Religiousness and Religion.

Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.ref{{Citation | title = The Huxleys | first = Ronald W | last = Clark | publisher = William Heinemann | place = London | year = 1968}}./ref They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]].  Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).ref{{Citation | first = George | last = Woodcock | year = 2007 | title = Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley | page = 240 | publisher=Black Rose Books}}./ref

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].ref{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate= 6 June 2011 |deadurl= no}}/ref

===United States===
In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood, with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the United States, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love, they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as Tarzana College in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley that year's [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.refHaugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009/ref Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''[[My Guru and His Disciple]]'', states that Huxley earned over $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to bring over Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the US. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (The film was eventually completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944).  Huxley was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on ''Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland'' and the biography of the story's author Lewis Carroll.  The script was not used, however.refhttp://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays//ref

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of JD Unwin's 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.ref{{Citation | first = JD | last = Unwin | title = Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society | year = 1940 | publisher = Oscar Piest | place = NY}}./ref

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.ref name= Smith{{cite book |last = Huxley | first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto  Windus |location=London |isbn = 978-0-7011-1312-4}}/ref}}

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians, to a naive public, as well-marketed commodities.ref{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}/ref

===Post World War II===
After World War II, Huxley applied for United States citizenship. His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the US. He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]].ref{{cite journal | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= http://www.charlestonvt.com/Holly/BCL/MCV%20Aldous%20Huxley/Originals/Derbyshire_WhatHappened.ORG.pdf | title = What Happened to Aldous Huxley? | first =J | last = Derbyshire | publisher = The New Criterion |year=2003}}/ref He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the country; and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]].

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God,ref name=IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}/ref translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''Knowledge and Understanding'' and ''Who Are We'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion.ref[[Michel Weber]], « [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing.

== Eyesight ==
There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha| adj =on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: Then suddenly he falterednbsp;— and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.ref name=GardnerCerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin | authorlink =Martin Gardner |title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2}}/ref

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.{{citation needed | date= February 2015}} After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered this: Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.ref name = Huxley{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |year=1968 |publisher= Farrar, Straus  Giroux |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-89087-968-9}}/ref Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.refRolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50.  Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California./ref

American [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer.  Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep.

By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon...refHuxley, ''The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell'', Harper Perennial, 1963, p.nbsp;15./refref{{cite book | last = Johnson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) |title = Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life | location =New York |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |page=235 |ISBN = 978-0-7432-4165-6}}/ref

== Personal life ==
Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899nbsp;– 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at Garsington, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920nbsp;– 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].ref[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84.] 17 February 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]''/ref

In 1956, Huxley married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author. She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley.

In 1960, Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]] and, in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',refPeter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969/ref and gave lectures on Human Potentialities both at the [[University of California]]'s San Francisco Medical Center and at the [[Esalen Institute]], which lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the [[Human Potential Movement]].ref{{cite book |last=Kripal |first=Jeffrey |title=Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007}}[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/453699.html excerpt]./ref

Huxley was a close friend of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]] and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School (now [[Besant Hill School]] of Happy Valley) in [[Ojai, California]].
